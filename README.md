Project 01 for NWs Coding Bootcamp - Richter Rumble!

## Description

- Our purpose in creating this game was to challenge one's cognitive abilities, strengthen memory and improve critical thinking. Mind games can be used for mental stimulation, social interaction and even relaxation, and at the start of the project, we were looking to create a game that was both fun and informative. Ultimately, the motivation behind a mind game is to engage the mind in a fun and stimulating way.

- We built this project because, within the framework of full-stack application development, creating a game is an excellent method to apply and practice different programming concepts and approaches. Games are inherently interactive and can provide an engaging user experience. Building a game helps you learn about user interface design, user experience considerations and how to create applications that captivate and retain users. Additionally, creating a game can be an enjoyable and captivating undertaking that showcases skill.

- Creating a mind game as a full-stack application can provide various benefits and solve different problems.
Mind games can be a fun and engaging way for users to challenge themselves and pass the time.
Mind games can help improve cognitive abilities, memory, problem-solving skills, and overall mental agility for users.
Mind games can be designed to educate users on specific topics or concepts, making learning enjoyable and interactive.
Mind games are a great way to incorporate features like user authentication, leaderboards, multiplayer options, and more to enhance user interaction and experience.

- Developing a game as a full-stack application can provide valuable learning opportunities.
Building a mind game involves working on both front end and back end, thus strengthening full-stack development skills.
Building a mind game requires thoughtful decision-making to ensure a smooth user experience (structuring a codebase and designing interactive interfaces).
Depending on game features, API integration is required for functionality.
Storing game data, user profiles, scores and other information in a database requires an understanding of database management.
Building a mind game involves thorough testing to ensure that the game functions correctly and delivers a seamless experience (practice testing strategies, debugging techniques and error handling).

## Usage

This browser-based application features front-end technologies, front-end frameworks and libraries, APIs and version control.

Once you have accessed the game application, you will be prompted to click on play or stats on the home page. If this is your first time playing, then you will click on the play button, as there will be nothing displayed on the stats page. After having clicked on play, you will be routed to the game page, which will show you a date at the top, followed by a map placeholder, remaining guesses, and then the section that brings us to the start of the game (guess how many earthquakes happened on this date). After having entered a number of your choosing, right above the guessing line will be a pop-up indicator for whether you guessed right or wrong, which also lets you know if you need to guess lower or higher (provides feedback on the player's guess). The game will track the player's score based on the number of correct guesses.
